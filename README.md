CARe is an express app which aims to provide an accessible way to
keep an eye on your car's fuel efficiency.

To start using CARe simply create an account and periodically enter
distance covered since your last entry and the amount of gas used to
cover the given distance. The amount of gas can be determined by the
amount needed to fill your tank at the next visit to the gas station.
